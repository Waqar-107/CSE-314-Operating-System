Shakib Al Hasan
Bangladesh

Allrounder

When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of 
its first two decades. His on-field performances and off-field professionalism set a benchmark that was followed by peers and juniors alike. 
As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.


Tamim Iqbal
Bangladesh

Batsman

Tamim Iqbal was already one of Bangladesh's most assured batsmen at the time of his 21st birthday, and will be
 a vital component at the top of the order for years to come. His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh 
cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through.


Mashrafe Mortaza
Bangladesh

Bowler

The quintessential country boy, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza epitomised the term "bursting onto the scene". 
He first came into attention during an under-17 regional tournament in 2001 when he bowled fast, 
slammed sixes and dived around without a care in the world.


Mustafizur Rahman
Bangladesh

Bowler

Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, 
after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the 
BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup.
